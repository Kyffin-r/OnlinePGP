**ONLINEPGP**

This online PGP tool I created uses the 2018 version of Pretty Good Privacy, as the newer versions are not available on CDNJS at the time of writing. Unfortunately, CDNJS has not yet updated to a more recent version, and I prefer not to include the latest PGP version directly in this repository.

I created this tool because I was frustrated with other online PGP tools that store your keys and encrypted messages, which could potentially be used against you or result in the theft of your Monero and Bitcoin, etc (or whatever other data you use PGP for). I also built it for those who are lazy or don't prioritize operational security and would rather not go through the trouble of using tools like Tails or a VPS.

You might notice some updates that make the website look a little more basic, but that's intentional. I want to keep it simple and user-friendly. **Additionally, the previous design was overly complicated in terms of CSS, which was generated by AI and didn't suit my preferences, hence the massive updates in the repo. ;)**

However, I welcome contributions that can help improve this tool, and I will do my best to keep it updated.

For reference, this tool currently links to the OpenPGP 4.0.1 version.[4.0.1 OpenPGP](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/openpgp/4.0.1/openpgp.min.js)
