**ONLINEPGP**

This online PGP tool I created uses the 2018 version of Pretty Good Privacy, as the newer versions are not available on CDNJS at the time of writing. Unfortunately, CDNJS has not yet updated to a more recent version, and I prefer not to include the latest PGP version directly in this repository.

However, I welcome contributions that can improve this tool, and I will make sure to keep it updated to the best of my ability.

For reference, this tool currently links to the OpenPGP 4.0.1 version.[4.0.1 OpenPGP](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/openpgp/4.0.1/openpgp.min.js)
